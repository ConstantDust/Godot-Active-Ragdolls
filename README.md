# Active Rigid-Body Ragdoll
## In summary...
A Godot plugin for Ragdolls that uses `RigidBody`, and `Generic6DOFJoint` instead of `PhysicalBone`. This allows for much more options regarding Ragdolls. The Godot's default ragdolls that use `PhysicalBone`s are generally all you will need in your game, **however** if you are trying to implement something special like **Active Ragdolls**, you will find `PhysicalBone`s to be unsatisfactory.
